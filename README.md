Reinforcement Learning AI impossible to win against.
You may want to use pickle to save the dataset to don't have to train it every time.
The main object of this program is to make a machine learning algorithm that could be applied to almost any game, without even using outside libraries. No Tensorflow. No Keras. No Fastai. Just import random.
